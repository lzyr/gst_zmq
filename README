ZeroMQ binding for GNU Smalltalk.

Right now we have the basic Request-Reply sockets working. 
Follow these steps to try out the plugin:
(Be warned that the code is not yet ready for real-world use!)

1. Install ZeroMQ (http://www.zeromq.org/)
2. Compile and install the C wrapper for some ZMQ calls:
    
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

4. Run the hello-world server:

     $ gst ./src/st/zmq.st ./src/st/zmq-server.st ./samples/hello-server.st 

5. Run the hello-world client in a new terminal:

     $ gst ./src/st/zmq.st ./src/st/zmq-server.st ./samples/hello-client.st
