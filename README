ZeroMQ binding for GNU Smalltalk.

Right now we have the basic Request-Reply sockets working and can
send/recv strings. Follow these steps to try out the plugin:

1. Install ZeroMQ (http://www.zeromq.org/)
2. ./build
3. ./deploy
4. Run the sample server and client:

   gst ./src/st/zmq.st ./tests/hello-server.st 

   gst ./src/st/zmq.st ./tests/hello-client.st 

(We will have a better build/deploy script soon!!)
